They can specify the mode of pay before bill generation.
Additionally the admins can also view the total purchase as well as individual purchase details, all of which is and stored in a CSV file and implemented using file handling functionality in python. Data type checking is also taken care of along with any other possible loopholes that the user accidentally may enter into, throwing appropriate errors as required.
